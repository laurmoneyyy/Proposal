# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

GreenSum Mobile App Project

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The mobile app allows users to buy plants and get them delivered to their house. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Greensum Mobile app is a plant e commerce store that allows users to buy plants and get them delivered to their house. Some features will include a reminder notification to water certain plants, a plant identification camera, and an a plant inventory where users can upload the type of plants they have and be reccommended more plants. For the plant idenitification camera, I am not sure how that will be executed but that will be the main feature of the app. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I am planning to combine this final project with my Mobile Apps Design and prototpying class. The development of the UI using JS,HTML,CSS, and React Native would relate to CIS 1051 because I'll be using different programming languages develop it. The design of the UI would relate to the mobile apps class because I have to design how the UI looks like on Figma before developing it.   

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my project would be to develop a working prototype for the app. (i.e buttons will function properly, input fields would allow users to type information, profile set up would work)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
A better outcome would be to complete the features listed above plus have the plant identification feature working perfectly ( I am not that confident in my abilities to complete that feature, but I will try my hardest). 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for the final project would be to have a fully developed mobile app with all the features listed above. Also, I would like to have a protoype of the app on my phone where I can show people the app physically. Finally, I would like to add transitions and animations to the screen so the app features can flow in a cohesive manner. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First, I need to research how to use React Native. I've never used React Native before so I've been watching tutorials on how it works. Then, I need to research putting together components. Finally, I need to research HTML, CSS and JS so I know how to style and develop the UI of the app. I am a complete beginner but I feel like this project would be super beneficial for me to develop and put on my portfolio. Finally, I need to conduct HEAVY research on how I would go about developing a plant identification feature for this app. A plant idenitification feature would allow users to point their camera at any plant and the app would detect what kind of plant that is. I know that would involve using some databases, so would have to research that as well.
